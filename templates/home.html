      <p class="lead">The value for V1 is chosen at random but such that it is correct in terms of its type. V2 is then assigned a value by means of a complex data structure, which is created by recursive descent from the value that V1 has been set to, in this case 6. The values of V1 can then be checked against that of V2. The same technique can be generalised for most of the constructs of a programming language. The main technical problem is preserving the correct semantics while doing the recursive descent. This technique has produced program generators, which have found many bugs in commercial compilers and has been used to give assurance for compilers in a safety-critical context.The value for V1 is chosen at random but such that it is correct in terms of its type.
